This code indicates that the server has received and is processing the request, but no response is available yet.[7] This prevents the client from timing out and assuming the request was lost.",
    103: "Used to return some response headers before final HTTP message.",
    200: "Standard response for successful HTTP requests.",
    201: "The request has been fulfilled, resulting in the creation of a new resource.",

    204: "The server successfully processed the request and is not returning any content.",
    205: "The server successfully processed the request, but is not returning any content. Unlike a 204 response, this response requires that the requester reset the document view.",

    300: "Indicates multiple options for the resource from which the client may choose.",
    301: "This and all future requests should be directed to the given URI.",
    302: "This is an example of industry practice contradicting the standard. The HTTP/1.0 specification (RFC 1945) required the client to perform a temporary redirect (the original describing phrase was \"Moved Temporarily\"), but popular browsers implemented 302 with the functionality of a 303 See Other. Therefore, HTTP/1.1 added status codes 303 and 307 to distinguish between the two behaviours.",
    303: "The response to the request can be found under another URI using the GET method.",

    423: "The resource that is being accessed is locked.",
    424: "The request failed because it depended on another request and that request failed.",
    425: "The server is unwilling to risk processing a request that might be replayed.",
    426: "The client should switch to a different protocol such as TLS/1.0, given in the Upgrade header field.",
    428: "The origin server requires the request to be conditional.",
    429: "The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time.",
    431: "The server is unwilling to process the request because either an individual header field, or all the header fields collectively, are too large.",

    500: "A generic error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered and no more specific message is suitable.",
